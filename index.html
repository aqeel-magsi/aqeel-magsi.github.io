<h2>Aqeel Abbas's Personal Webpage</h2>
<!-- <img src="Images/new_profile.png" class="imgLeft" /> -->
<div class="a"> I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/sci/essc/people/abbas_aqeel.html"> The Chinese University of Hong Kong </a>, Hong Kong, SAR, since August 2020. My work focuses on Induced Earthquake in Sichuan Basin, China. I have done my masters degree from <a href="http://oc.zju.edu.cn/">Ocean College, Zhejiang University </a> , China. Additionally, my <a href="./docs/Aqeel_resume_github.pdf"> Resume</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aqeelkhan14125/">LinkedIn</a> has more information about myself. The details of some of my research projects are provided below:

<h3> Induced Earthquakes </h3>
<p>
    I am currently working on physics-based simulations of earthquake rupture propagation on Cascadia subduction zone to understand shallow rupture process effects 
    on the tsunami generation. I previously worked on rupture modeling of geometrically complex strike-slip faults to 
    examine the off-fault stress changes resulting from dynamic fault slip. I consider many different realizations of the rough 
    fault profile and use the output of the dynamic rupture simulations to calculate the Coulomb failure function (CFF) for each realization. 
    Details of the project are available in pdfs present in my publication page.

<h3>Clock Drift Inspection and Correction in Seismic Data</h3>
<p>
    Temporary seismic network deployments are widely used both on land and offshore to improve our understanding of earthquake processes and the internal structure of the Earth.
    However, some temporary stations suffer from incorrect timing records and thus pose a challenge to fully utilize the valuable data.
    To inspect and fix such time problems, we examine the OBS data from the Mariana subduction zone and land data from a dense array deployed in
    the Weiyuan shale gas field, Sichuan, China.
    Initially, we inspected the teleseismic and local events waveforms to evaluate the overall clock drift and data quality in both datasets.
    Later, the ambient noise cross-correlation function (NCCF) is adopted by using daily waveforms with different stratigies for both Land and OBS datasets.
    All the clock drifts in both dataset are successfully analysed and corrected. 
    The codes are avaible upon request at <font color="blue"> aqeelabbas(@)link.cuhk.edu.hk </font>. Deatils of the project are available in pdfs present in my publication page.

<h3> Seismic Ambient noise </h3>
<p>
   We (I and my collaborators) processed the seismic ambient noise data for few years from the New Madrid seismic region. The data was used to find the major  
   direction of the ambient noise sources and also to observe the embayment edge generated surface waves. We used beam forming, SNR ratio and relative amplitude 
   approach to find the sources. additionally, we also looked at the change in seismic velocity relation as a function of time with the climatological data. 
    Details of the project are available in pdfs present in my publication page. The ML code is present in repositories link.

<h3> Ocean Bottom Seismic (OBS) Data Processing and interpretation </h3>
<p>
   We (I and my collaborators of the project) estimated the max. possible magnitude of an induced earthquake in 
    Oklahoma using Machine learning approach. We do this by running multiple ruptures on a complex strike-slip fault with inherent fault roughness. The rupture nucleation is provided through the elevated
    pore pressure. We use full length of the fault (400 parameter), stresses ( 3 parameters), Slip weakening law (3 parameters), RMS height of fault (1 parameter) with 4000 rupture simulations to train
    our model for a regression problem that can predict earthquake magnitudes. To train a model, we use neural networks with three hidden layers and 10 units in each layer. This work is build upon a previous
    study done by our group (Elizabeth Gilmour). Details of the project are available in pdfs present in my publication page. The ML code is present in repositories link.

<h3>Full 3D waveform Modeling</h3>
<p>
    I perform three-dimensional (3D) deterministic
earthquake ground motion simulations for the northern Canterbury plains,
Christchurch and the Banks Peninsula region of New Zealand, which explicitly incorporate the
effects of the surface topography. The simulations are done using Hercules, an
octree-based finite-element parallel software for solving 3D seismic wave
propagation problems in heterogeneous media under kinematic faulting. We
describe the efforts undertaken to couple Hercules with the South Island Velocity
Model (SIVM), which included changes to the SIVM code in order to allow for single
repetitive queries and thus achieve a seamless final-element meshing process
within the end-to-end approach adopted in Hercules. Details 
of the project are avaliable in pdfs present in my publication page.
